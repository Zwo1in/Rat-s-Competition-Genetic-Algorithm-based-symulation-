// Graphical library used: SFML 2.4.2
// Not much else to say, if you've read other header files.
// It's simple simulaiton of 5 teams of triangles ( called "rats" ) competing in finding way to the target
// The goal is to make 60% of rats in team make it to the target
// Teams evolves separately
// The weakness is a control system which lacks a ANN
// It uses some of my other repos: Game loop handler, SAT colsiion detection and sorts
// Enjoy watching!
