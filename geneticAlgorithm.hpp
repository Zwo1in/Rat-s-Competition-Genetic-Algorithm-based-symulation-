// This class is the static Genetic Algorithm system
// It calculates how well does unit does in the given environment
// Calculates unit's propability of being chosen for a dna's giver for next evolution
// Has implemented algorithm of choosing a random parent
// evolves whole population, basicaly the main function which gets everything done
