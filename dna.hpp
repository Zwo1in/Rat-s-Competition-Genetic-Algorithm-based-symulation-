// The DNA's class
// That's the greatest weakness of whole simulation, as it just begs for the neural network
// Haven't made any yet, so I implemented it similiar to "The Coding Train" channel on youtube ( the smart rockets video )
// https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman

// There is a vector given, with te length of the live time of the rats
// each cell has a certain rotation that rat uses at each time point
// to make this work I had to give up on crossing DNA's and I'm just replacing the dnas with the other one after mutations
