# Rat-s-Competition-Genetic-Algorithm-based-symulation-
It's a simple simulaiton of 5 teams of the triangles ( called "rats" ) competing in finding way to the target. Each team has different mutation strenght and rate also teams evlolves separately from each other. 

The general idea source:

Graphical library used: SFML 2.4.2\
Not much else to say, if you've read other header files.\
It's simple simulaiton of 5 teams of triangles ( called "rats" ) competing in finding way to the target\
The goal is to make 60% of rats in team make it to the target\
Teams evolves separately\
The weakness is a control system which lacks a ANN\
It uses some of my other repos: Game loop handler, SAT colsiion detection and sorts\
Enjoy watching!\
