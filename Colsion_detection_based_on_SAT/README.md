# Colsion-check-based-on-SAT

This is my implementation of colision detection based on separated axis theorem for given shapes:
Rectangles
Triangles
Circles
Adding general polygons implementation is present in my plans, gonna do that when I'll have some more free time

Everything got packed into namespace to not colide with the sfml classes and for readability
I'm using sfml's vector's class just for my comfort, you can easily implement your own and replace it

Members of the shapes classes are public, I've used python mentality here, again for my own comfort, feel free to add set/get's as you want
Colision methods are static
